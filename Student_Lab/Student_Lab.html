			<h1>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</h1>
			<p>Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Goldilocks. For some reason,
				she finds herself in a forest being unbearably hungry. Luckily for her, she stumbles
				upon a cottage in the forest and decides to commit a felony and break into the house.
				She finds 3 sets of porridge, and decides to try the first one. It is too hot for her. 
				She tries the second one, and finds that it is way too cold for her. She tries the last one,
				and it is just perfect for her. She then left the cottage because she realized she just committed
				a crime. The end.
