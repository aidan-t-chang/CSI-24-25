                <p>Linked Lists are a fundamental data structure present in almost every
                programming language. Each linked list contains a value and a pointer
                towards the next node. The term "linked" comes from the fact that the 
                values within the list are linked to each other, meaning it is a little
                harder to insert and remove elements, since all the values are connected
                to each other in a predetermined way. Linked lists were first used around
                the 1950s and ever since, they have been a key stepping stone to fundamentally
                understanding all data structures and algorithms.

                <h4>Why Linked Lists?</h4>

                <p>Why choose a linked list instead of a regular list? Great question. While 
                    the strict methods of the linked list may seem detrimental, they are there
                    for a reason. While programming the insertion and deletion for linked lists may
                    seem unnecessarily hard, it allows for much faster time complexities for insertion and deletion.
                    Linked lists are also good for dynamic programming situations, where the data structure's size
                    must constantly change. Overall, linked lists are a powerful data structure that are used
                    as the building block to many other data structures due to their efficiency compared to a regular
                    unsorted, unorganized array.

                <h4>How does a linked list work?</h4>

                <p>A linked list first starts at the definition of the node:</p>
                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--S_XLvaPf--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_720,q_auto,w_1280/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/pwj5nwuqf5lgpsxb0eao.png"
                width="40%"
                height="40%">
                <p>Value gives each node a value, and next_node is what allows nodes to connect to each other.</p>

                <h4>How do we connect nodes to teach other to make a linked list?</h4>
                <p>Connecting nodes to each other is as easy as setting the next values. Setting the next values will
                    allow us to create an actual linked list, being able to traverse through the nodes using the 
                    ".next_node" attribute.
