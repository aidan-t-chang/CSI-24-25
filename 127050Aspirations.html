    <h1 align="center">My Aspirations for 2024-25</h1>

    <p align="center">My name is Aidan Chang and my preferred pronouns are he/him. 
        <br>Before IMSA, I went to Whitney M. Young Magnet High School located in Chicago. 
        There, I took an Intermediate Computer Science class and familiarized myself with 
        <br>DrRacket and recursive functions. This was a precursor to the eventual start of my 
        interview LeetCode grind and beginning of my competitive programming journey. 
        <br>On top of anything, I'd love to do some sort of 
        computer science as a career or something in quantitative finance. 
        <br>I play golf, basketball, volleyball, and also love lifting weights. 
        I actually don't know too much about web development, so I am excited to learn 
        that in this class.</p>

        lean muscle by the end of the year.
        <br> Extracurriculars: Golf team, Basketball team, and Volleyball team. Stembassadors, 
        tutoring, and potentially eSports.
