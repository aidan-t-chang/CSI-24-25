            <h2>Personal Life</h2>
            <p class="bigger">My name is Aidan Chang, and I've had a passion for computer science 
                for quite some time now. 
                Nothing makes me more excited than being able to learn something 
                new about computer science or having to solve another problem.
                Approaching computer science (and the rest of my life) with this 
                mindset has changed the way that I do and complete things. 
                This excitement is what has made me improve my coding exponentially, 
                and I hope to be able to spread that passion to you.<br> 
                I am from Chicago, Illinois and that is where I primarily reside.
                I attended Whitney M. Young Magnet High School for my freshman year of high school, 
                and I am now currently at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy for 
                my sophomore year. I love to remain active, playing basketball, volleyball, and golf for high school.
                In my free time, it's hard to pull myself away from competitive programming and learning more about the backend.</p>

            <h2>Coding Life</h2>
            <p class="bigger">Coding has always played an integral part of my life. From solving annoying math problems to competing weekly, 
                I'm always thinking about coding in one way or another. Every week, I compete as much as I can over as many websites as I can,
                and each week I get more and more excited to compete again and get better. I have completed over 240 LeetCode problems, over 90 CodeChef problems,
                and many other USACO-based and Codeforces problems.
