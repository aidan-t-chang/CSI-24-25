    as well as what was going to be gone over in the class. I also styled them using CSS to make them look a little prettier.-->

            <h2>Survey Tutoring</h2>
            <p>This tutoring program will be a multi-person class where you will be open
                to ask questions about your computer science assignments and also learn the basics
                of computer science. The class will last 8 weeks, meeting once or twice a week and will 
                require minimal amounts of time outside of sessions. 
                This class will be taught in python and will go over the following topics:

            <p>These tutoring sessions will follow a very similar format to the survey tutoring, except for the fact that
                significantly more complicated topics will be learned and taught. The full course will be 8 weeks long, and the
                accelerated course will be 6 weeks long. The sessions will be taught in Python. We will meet twice a week and will require 1-2 hours of extra practice per week.
                The topics are as following:

            <h2>1 on 1 Tutoring</h2>
            <p>The 1 on 1 tutoring will not follow a strict curriculum, but instead follow either the Survey Tutoring or the Data Structures and Algorithms classes,
                based on your choice. These sessions will be more personalized, allowing you to learn faster and understand
                concepts better. Because there is no strict curriculum, there is no set length of the course, instead going
                on as long as you want it to. If you have done a Survey Tutoring or Data Structures and Algorithms tutoring course,
                your first month of 1 on 1 tutoring will be completely free.
