    Purpose: This website is an example website detailing a (currently) fictional computer science tutoring
    place. At some point in the future, I might expand on this website and turn the tutoring into a real thing.
    But for now, this website is purely to demonstrate my web development abilities and variety of different
    elements I can use in HTML and style in CSS. -->
