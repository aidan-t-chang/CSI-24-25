                    The Binary Search algorithm is a common search algorithm due to 
                    its relative simplicity to implement and fast time complexity. 
                    It works by constantly splitting the search array into two each
                    time you cannot find the element, quite literally halving the
                    possible search elements each time. This leads the algorithm to
                    have a O(logn) <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-complexity-and-space-complexity/">time complexity</a>, which is substantially better
                    than O(n) and will work better on large data sets. The only
                    bottleneck about the algorithm is the fact that the array must be
                    sorted first before performing the search algorithm. This is due
                    to the fact that the algorithm relies on a "upper/lower" method,
                    in which we check if the target number is equal to, 
                    higher, or lower than the current number (set in the middle each iteration) we are at. This is how
                    it is possible to split the array in two each time; either we have
                    found the element, or we know that all the numbers on one side of 
                    the array cannot be the element no matter what. Learn more by
